Duck:   I was sitting in my office when the call came in. A priest impaled by his own 		sacred pole; a tour guide stumbling over the phone, describing hte massacare as 	it unfolded. I arrived at the scene, not knowing that his would be the biggest 		mystery of my life . . .


				(Insert Buttons Here)

TOUR GUIDE:
 - "Have you noticed anyhting odd about the area before the murder took place?"

	Not much . . . I DID notice the sacred pole missing from it's usual spot, but 	I'm sure you know where it went.

 - "What relations do you have with the Victim?"

	I'm just a tour guide here . . . Ca you not see my Badge?

- "Is If it wasn't you, then who do you think it woud be?"

	Have you seen some of the people here? I mean . . . Just look at (Shady)! All 		day he's been going on and on about how "The service is terrible" and how "He 		thinks the water is *Too Cold*". I even saw him yelling at the priest last 		night, and we all know what happened after that . . . All I'm saying is I'd 		keep an eye on him if I were you. (Unlocks dilaogue for John Shady)

JOHN SHADY:
 - (Unlocked after Tour Guide) Why were you arguing with the Victim Yesterday?

	He is not at ALL like an actual priest! I mean look at him! Not even wearing 		the traditional robes of Preisthood, It's absurd! Now, I wouldn't go as far to 		. . . *kill* him, but I had to say something about the way he presents himself. 	I mean, yellow, of all colours.

 - "Have you noticed anyhting odd about the area before the murder took place?"

	Other than the TERRIBLE service , not really. 

 - "What relations do you have with the Victim?"

	Do I look like I know the Priest? Come on, did you think I worked here or 		something?

 - "Is If it wasn't you, then who do you think it woud be?"
	
	I think I saw the Nun leave the monistary before . . . well  . . . you know 		what happened. Id ask her more about where she was. (Unlocks dialogue for Nun)

NUN:
 - (Unlocked after John Shady) Where were you on the night of the event?

	I'm seeing the mechanic from the city.

 - "What relations do you have with the Victim?"

	I only really knew him on a buisness level. He seemed nice, though.

- "Have you noticed anyhting odd about the area before the murder took place?"

	I saw some DNA matches on the Priests table . . . Says he has a daughter. Who 		knew?

 - "Is If it wasn't you, then who do you think it would be?"

	The groundskeeper has been arguing with Flirteen for YEARS. If anybody, it'd be 	him. (Unlockes dialogue with Groundskeeper)
